# NullPointerException in Scala Custom Class Addition

This example demonstrates a NullPointerException that can occur in Scala when adding instances of a custom class.  The `add` method doesn't handle the case where one of the instances is null, leading to the exception.

The solution shows how to handle null values gracefully to prevent the exception.
